## UX
The goal of Quiz - Fun is to provide users with fun, short quizzes on a variety of subjects.  The look is simple, and it easy to navigate.  It is easy to add new subjects, the script-data.js page can be copied and edited with a new subject and questions, and linked to index.html.

## Color Scheme
The color scheme for Quiz - Fun is clean and simple, a light gray background on the opening page and buttons and messages are in primary colors.  The logo is a red question mark on a black background.
* rgb(235, 233, 233) is the background color for the opening page
* #000000 (black) is used for the opening page and question text

## Typography
Quiz-Fun uses one font, Poppins, utilizing Poppins at a different weights for the title, button text, questions and scores. Poppins italic at a smaller size was used for the source text that displays at the bottom of the page for each question. 

## Wireframe
The original design of Quiz - Fun was going to utilize an image to display the question next to the buttons for answer choices. The final design did not use images so that it would be easier to add more subjects.  Also the centered design makes the site easily responsive, with only a few size changes in media queries for smaller screens.
